create a prompt that will write an python application that will help  me be successful in applying for a job

context; i am junior data scientist trained in the domain of bioinformatics with masters degree in computer vision (cnns and temporal convolutional networks) for surgical simulation feedback (workflow recognition) and some research expirience. i am interested in data science, ai, and machine learning as well as data pipelines that support them. my background is in healthcare related applications which i am still interested in, but i am also looking to apply for jobs in any other fields that require data scientist skills. i am canadian resident and applying for jobs in canada.

do a research which web sites have postings for those types of jobs.

also do a research on how to make my job application successful - test hypotesis that submiting a code repo with working application, live demo would increase my chances of getting an inteview

i would also like jobs to be classified based on how closely they match my profile and for those that do have high match do analysis of common requirements.

summarize common requirements so that i can feed them to llm to propose concrete projects for me to supervise llm development.

for this app use python and build simple streamlit ui.

for rag use posgresql with pgvector.

our development approach will follow the paradigm where we will start with vision.md document identifying what and why are we building, this will then be broken into set of features which are then broken into epics and user stories.

those will be stored in git wiki and once refined they will be populating git issues based on specific templates you will help me design (vision, feature, epic, user story)

you will use gh to integrate with git.

i would like scanning of jobs to run daily and then i get summary of new jobs with link sorted by how closely they match my profile.

store this in 02-prompt.md
