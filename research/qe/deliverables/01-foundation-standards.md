# Foundation: Standards and Ontologies

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete
**Purpose:** Establish authoritative baseline definitions and understand existing ontological frameworks

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides the foundational knowledge for creating a comprehensive Quality Engineering ontological taxonomy. It synthesizes information from:
- International standards (ISTQB, ISO/IEC, IEEE)
- Existing software testing ontologies (ROoST, TestTDO, STOWS)
- Quality engineering bodies of knowledge (ASQ CQE, TMAP)

The research confirms that while several ontologies exist, there is an opportunity to create a more comprehensive, YAML-based taxonomy that integrates best practices from all sources and addresses modern testing needs (AI, accessibility, DevOps, microservices).
