# Domain IV: Test Levels with Complete DDD and UX Integration

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Status:** Complete Working Document
**Purpose:** Comprehensive research on test levels integrated with Domain-Driven Design patterns and UX architecture for the Job Seeker application

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides authoritative research on the four ISTQB test levels—Component/Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, and Acceptance Testing—with complete integration to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) tactical and strategic patterns, and UX architecture patterns (Atomic Design, page types, workflows).

Each test level is mapped to:
- **DDD constructs**: What domain patterns to test (Value Objects, Entities, Aggregates, Repositories, Application Services, Bounded Contexts)
- **UX patterns**: What interface patterns to test (Atoms/Molecules, Organisms/Pages, Workflows, User Journeys)
- **Job Seeker examples**: Concrete examples from the Job Seeker application domain

**Key Integration Points:**
- Component/Unit: Value Objects ↔ Atoms/Molecules
- Integration: Aggregates/Repositories ↔ Organisms/Pages
- System: Bounded Contexts ↔ Workflows
- Acceptance: Use Cases ↔ User Journeys

## 1. Component/Unit Testing

### ISTQB Definition

**Component Testing** (also known as Unit Testing, Module Testing, or Program Testing) is the testing of individual hardware or software components that are separately testable.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Tests individual components in isolation
- Automated and run frequently
- Test-first approach (TDD)
- Fast execution (milliseconds)

---

### DDD Integration: Testing Value Objects and Entities

**Testing Value Objects**:
- Immutability
- Validation rules
- Equality based on attributes
- Business rule enforcement

**Job Seeker Example: `vo_email`**
```yaml
test_cases:
  - "Valid email creates Email value object"
  - "Invalid format throws ValidationException"
  - "Email is immutable (no setters)"
  - "Two emails with same value are equal"
```

**Testing Entities**:
- Identity equality
- Business logic methods
- State transitions
- Domain events

---

### UX Integration: Testing Atoms and Molecules

**Testing Atoms**:
- Rendering with props
- User interactions (click, hover, focus)
- Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard)

**Job Seeker Example: `atom_button`**
```yaml
test_cases:
  - "Button renders with text"
  - "Button handles click event"
  - "Disabled button doesn't trigger onClick"
  - "Button keyboard accessible"
```

**Testing Molecules**:
- Composition of atoms
- Validation logic
- Domain integration

**Job Seeker Example: `comp_email_input`**
```yaml
test_cases:
  - "Email input validates on blur"
  - "Validation matches vo_email rules"
  - "Error messages display inline"
```

---

## 2. Integration Testing

### ISTQB Definition

**Integration Testing** tests interfaces and interactions between integrated components.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Tests component interactions
- Uses real dependencies (database, etc.)
- Focuses on integration points

---

### DDD Integration: Testing Aggregates and Services

**Testing Aggregates**:
- Consistency boundaries
- Domain event publication
- Transaction atomicity

**Job Seeker Example: `agg_candidate_profile`**
```yaml
test_cases:
  - "Profile enforces consistency (≥1 skill required)"
  - "Update publishes CandidateProfileUpdated event"
  - "Profile completeness calculated correctly"
```

**Testing Repositories**:
- CRUD operations
- Query completeness
- Concurrency handling

**Testing Application Services**:
- Use case orchestration
- Event publication
- Error handling

---

### UX Integration: Testing Organisms and Pages

**Testing Organisms**:
- Component composition
- Data flow
- Complex interactions

**Job Seeker Example: `org_job_card`**
```yaml
test_cases:
  - "Job card displays all job details"
  - "Match score badge shows if provided"
  - "Click navigates to job detail"
```

**Testing Pages**:
- Data loading from repositories
- Form submission to services
- Navigation flows

**Job Seeker Example: `page_profile_edit`**
```yaml
test_cases:
  - "Page loads current profile data"
  - "Save calls UpdateProfileService"
  - "Success shows toast notification"
  - "Validation errors display inline"
```

---

## 3. System Testing

### ISTQB Definition

**System Testing** tests the complete integrated system against specified requirements.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Tests entire system
- Production-like environment
- Both functional and non-functional testing

---

### DDD Integration: Testing Bounded Contexts

**Testing Complete Contexts**:
- All use cases work end-to-end
- Cross-context event propagation
- Business capabilities

**Job Seeker Example: `bc_applications`**
```yaml
test_cases:
  - "Submit application workflow (create → save → event → confirmation)"
  - "Application status tracking (status changes trigger notifications)"
  - "Cross-context: Application affects bc_profile, bc_job_catalog"
```

---

### UX Integration: Testing Workflows

**Testing Complete Workflows**:
- Multi-step completion
- Progress indication
- Data persistence
- Error recovery

**Job Seeker Example: `wf_submit_application`**
```yaml
workflow_steps:
  1. View job details
  2. Review profile
  3. Submit application
  4. See confirmation

test_cases:
  - "User can complete workflow start to finish"
  - "Progress indicator shows current step"
  - "Success publishes ApplicationSubmitted event"
  - "Confirmation email sent"
```

---

## 4. Acceptance Testing

### ISTQB Definition

**Acceptance Testing** determines if system satisfies acceptance criteria and meets user needs.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Business requirements focus
- User involvement
- Business value validation

---

### DDD Integration: Testing Use Cases

**Testing Application Services**:
- Business requirements met
- Acceptance criteria validated
- Business rules enforced

**Job Seeker Example: Submit Application User Story**
```gherkin
Feature: Submit Job Application
  As a job seeker,
  I want to submit an application for a job posting,
  So that I can be considered for the position.

Scenario: Successful application submission
  Given candidate with complete profile
  And active job posting
  When candidate submits application
  Then application created with SUBMITTED status
  And ApplicationSubmitted event published
  And confirmation email sent
  And application appears in candidate's list
```

---

### UX Integration: Testing User Journeys

**Testing Complete Journeys**:
- Real user goals
- Business value delivery
- Usability validation

**Job Seeker Example: First-Time User Journey**
```yaml
journey_steps:
  1. Sign up and verify email
  2. Create profile with skills
  3. Browse jobs (see match scores)
  4. Apply for high-match job
  5. Track application status

success_criteria:
  - Complete in <10 minutes
  - User feels confident
  - User understands next steps
```

## Integration Matrix

| Test Level | DDD Focus | UX Focus | Example |
|------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Component/Unit | Value Objects, Entities | Atoms, Molecules | `vo_email` ↔ `comp_email_input` |
| Integration | Aggregates, Repositories | Organisms, Pages | `agg_candidate_profile` ↔ `page_profile_edit` |
| System | Bounded Contexts | Workflows | `bc_applications` ↔ `wf_submit_application` |
| Acceptance | Use Cases | User Journeys | Submit application story |
