## Key Deliverables

### 1. **Foundation and Standards** (`01-foundation-standards.md`)
- Analyzed ISTQB Foundation Level standards
- Mapped ISO 25010 quality characteristics (8 characteristics, 31 sub-characteristics)
- Reviewed existing testing ontologies (ROoST, TestTDO, STOWS)
- Established terminology cross-reference across ISTQB, ISO, DDD, UX

### 2. **DDD-UX-QE Integration Framework** (`QE-DDD-UX-INTEGRATION.md`)
- Defined three-layer testing strategy (Domain, Application, Presentation)
- Mapped DDD constructs to test targets (Value Objects → Unit Tests, Aggregates → Integration Tests)
- Mapped UX patterns to test scenarios (Components → Component Tests, Workflows → E2E Tests)
- Established cross-reference system for test artifacts

### 3. **Test Levels Research** (`04-domain-IV-test-levels.md`)

## Integration Achievements

### DDD Integration

**What We Achieved:**
- Every DDD tactical pattern has corresponding test pattern
- Test strategy aligned with bounded context boundaries
- Domain events tested for correct publication and handling
- Repository interfaces tested at integration level
- Application services tested as complete use cases

**Example Mapping:**
```
vo_email → Unit Test (validation rules)
agg_candidate_profile → Integration Test (consistency boundary)
bc_applications → System Test (complete business capability)
svc_app_submit_application → Acceptance Test (user story)
```

### UX Integration

**What We Achieved:**
- Atomic Design hierarchy mapped to test levels
- Page Object Model integrated with page definitions
- Workflows tested as complete user journeys
- Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.2 Level AA) included
- Component tests aligned with domain validation

**Example Mapping:**
```
atom_button → Unit Test (rendering, interaction)
comp_email_input → Unit Test (validation matching vo_email)
page_profile_edit → Integration Test (load aggregate, save via service)
wf_submit_application → E2E Test (complete user journey)
```
