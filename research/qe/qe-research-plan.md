## Risk Management

### Potential Challenges

**Challenge 1: Access to Standards**
- *Risk*: ISO/IEEE standards may require purchase
- *Mitigation*:
  - Use university/library access if available
  - Leverage publicly available summaries and secondary sources
  - Focus on ISTQB (free) and publicly available materials
  - Use standards previews and abstracts

**Challenge 2: Scope Creep**
- *Risk*: Topic is vast, could expand indefinitely
- *Mitigation*:
  - Strict adherence to the 43 topics in qe-prompt.md
  - Time-box each domain research period
  - Mark "future research" areas without diving deep
  - Focus on breadth first, depth where critical

**Challenge 3: Conflicting Definitions**
- *Risk*: Different sources may define terms differently
- *Mitigation*:
  - Prioritize ISTQB glossary as primary source
  - Document multiple perspectives
  - Note conflicts explicitly
  - Explain context for variations

**Challenge 4: Rapidly Evolving Field**
- *Risk*: New practices emerge constantly (AI testing, etc.)
- *Mitigation*:
  - Focus on fundamentals that remain stable
  - Clearly mark emerging topics as evolving
  - Design taxonomy for extensibility
  - Document as of specific date (2025)

**Challenge 5: Ontology Complexity**
- *Risk*: Creating a comprehensive ontology is inherently complex
- *Mitigation*:
  - Learn from existing ontologies (ROoST, TestTDO, STOWS)
  - Start simple, iterate and refine
  - Validate incrementally
  - Seek feedback if possible
